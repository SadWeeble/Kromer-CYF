# Kromer-CYF
Create Your Kris was made in CYF v0.6.2.2. That's old. Before masks and shaders, even. 
Many of the things it does are not best practice, and much of the code could be simplified.
So, why should you use Kromer over CYK?

## 1) It's Faithful


## 2) It's Flexible


## 3) It's Just Easier
