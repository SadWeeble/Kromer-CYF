# Kromer-CYF
Create Your Kris was made in CYF v0.6.2.2. That's old. Before masks and shaders, even. Despite the fact that it is being updated, many of the things it does are just not the best practice, and much of the code could be simplified.
So, why should you trust me over the CREATOR of CYF and use Kromer instead of CYK?

## 1) It's Faithful
There are a lot of small details that CYK overlooks. Sometimes for performance, sometimes just because it wasn't possible in v0.6.2.2. Flashes and particles and screen shakes - they're all here, and as close to the source as possible.

## 2) It's Flexible
Kromer has widescreen support* and 30FPS support*, and fights can contain any number of enemies, heroes, acts, and spells.

## 3) It's Just Easier
CYK has some weird quirks that stem from its sandboxing code. Kromer is set up in such a way that you don't have to write code that the engine could handle for you. Additionally, managing downloaded mods for Kromer is a cakewalk thanks to the package system and the package select encounter*!

## 4) Overworld?!
Kromer may have its own overworld system added in a future update, and maybe even an in-engine map editor.
