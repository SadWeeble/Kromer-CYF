-- The animations table --
-- KROMER searches "Heroes/<hero name>/<animation name or refer><addition>/<frame name>"
-- The first argument is the name of the frames
-- The second argument is the speed of the animation (Seconds per frame)
-- The third argument contains various miscellaneous information
     -- loopmode  - The animation's loop mode
     -- next      - Queues an animation after the current one
     -- immediate - If the animation doesn't loop, the queued animation plays immediately after
     -- offset    - The X & Y offset of the animation
     -- addition  - An additional string added to the search path of the animation, after the animation name. supply a function, and it's run every time the animation switches
     -- refer     - Replaces the animation name portion of the search path, if supplied
     -- onselect  - If supplied, this animation will play when the hero selects the supplied action.
